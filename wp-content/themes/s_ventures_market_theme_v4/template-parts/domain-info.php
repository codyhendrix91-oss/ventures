      At S Ventures we have spent the last 20 years acquiring premium internet real estate to use for our own ventures ranging from software &amp; cutting-edge AI platforms to physical products, e-commerce, and home &amp; financial services. In this industry, as you may already know, there are many times that a project or idea never gets off the ground, or a brand name we thought was the perfect fit ends up being second-best.
    </p>

    <p>
      So while we wait for these projects to come to life, or invest in other ventures, we have decided to offer our portfolio of domain names for sale, lease-to-own, and even equity or revenue share structured deals, so that way other start-ups and ventures can enjoy the domain names we invested in as their new brand name instead of them collecting dust waiting for our next project that may never come around.
